## Dataset description

This dataset contains raw images that have transformed given some geometric transformations.

## Data source
Images have been transformed using the code of the section "Preparation of the dataset" in the notebook "inverse_compositional_algorithm.ipynb".
The transformations used are also given in the code of this section.

## Files list
For the moment, only the rubber_whale.png image has been transformed. The transformed images are:
- rubber_whale_tr.png (to test the translation calculation)
- rubber_whale_rt.png (to test the rotation calculation)
- rubber_whale_eu.png (to test the euclidean transformation calculation)
- rubber_Whale_zo.png (to test the zoom calculation)
